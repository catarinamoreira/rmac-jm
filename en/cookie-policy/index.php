					<p>We use cookies on our website to improve performance and your experience as a user. This document explains how we do this.</p>
					<h3>What are cookies?</h3>
					<p>"Cookies" are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device through the Internet browser that gather information related only to your preferences, not your personal data. The use of cookies enables the website to recognise the device the next time the user visits it.</p>
					<p>The term "cookies" is used in this policy to refer to all files that gather information in this way.</p>
					<p>The cookies used do not gather information that can identify users. Cookies collect generic information, such as how users accessed the website, or the country zone(s) they accessed the website from, etc.
Cookies only gather information related to your preferences. Users may, at any time, through their Internet browser, decide to be notified about the receipt of cookies, or block cookies from being stored on their system.
Refusing to accept cookies on a website may result in users being unable to access certain areas, or to receive personalised information.</p>
					<h3>What are Cookies used for?</h3>
					<p>Cookies help determine the usefulness, interest in and number of uses of the websites on which they are stored, enabling users to navigate more quickly and efficiently, and eliminating the need to enter the same information over and over again.</p>
					<h3>What type of cookies do we use?</h3>
					<p>Our cookies have different functions:</p>
					<p class="nob"><b>Cookies that are strictly necessary (essential)</b></p>
					<p>Enable navigation of the website and the use of its applications, such as access to secure areas of the website. Without these cookies, services that have been requested cannot be provided. Some cookies are essential for gaining access to specific areas of our website.</p>
					<p class="nob"><b>Analytics Cookies</b></p>
					<p>Used to analyse how users use the website, and to monitor its performance. This enables us to provide a high-quality experience by personalising our offer and quickly identifying and correcting any problems that may arise. For example, we use performance cookies to find out which pages are the most popular, to identify the most effective method of linking between pages or to determine the rate of error messages on certain pages. These cookies are only used for the purposes of creation and analysis of statistical data; they will never gather information of a personal nature.</p>
					<p class="nob"><b>Functionality Cookies</b></p>
					<p>Store user preferences for a particular website so that the website does not need to be reconfigured with each visit.</p>
					<p class="nob"><b>Third-party Cookies</b></p>
					<p>Measure the success of applications and the effectiveness of third-party advertising. They may also be used to personalise a widget with the user's data.</p>
					<h3>Types of cookies:</h3>
					<p class="nob"><b>Persistent Cookies</b></p>
					<p>These are stored, for a variable period of time, on the Internet browser and on devices (PC, mobile phone, tablet), and are used whenever users visit the website. They are generally used to focus the browsing according to the user's interests, enabling us to provide a more personalised service.</p>
					<p class="nob"><b>Session Cookies</b></p>
					<p>These are temporary; they are only stored in your browser's "cookies" folder until you leave the website. The information they collect enables problems to be identified and leads to a better navigation experience.</p>
